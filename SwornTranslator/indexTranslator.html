        <p>We are the hightest ranked translation service in the Southern Province.</p>
        <p>We translate all the documents that you require in order to travel abroad. Our fees are reasonable and we are committed to maintaining our accuracy. We rarely make mistakes in our translations and we have been able to maintain an accuracy of 98.7% and that is one of the reasons behind our popularity. We do care whether our clients get to accomplish their goals of going abroad or not and we maintain friendly relations with our clients even after the service is rendered.</p>
        <p>We do not have plans to expand our service yet. However we deliver a quick and efficient service to the clients in our area, meaning the Elpitiya and Karandeniya electorates.</p>
        <p>We have recently started collaborating with certain partner services in order to deliver you more services with an increased capacity and those details can be found under the section on collaborators.</p>
